Cheese could be it's own food group, and honestly, I don't know why it isn't. However, the next best thing would be cheese and bread combined. One night while perusing UberEats, I found this amazing little Brazilian place in Redmond that had food that I could eat without feeling like I was going to die. 

I knew this was something that I had to try to make at home- and by "I had to try to make", I mean I had to try to ask Cameron  to make! And he did! 

Taking a bite out of these is like biting Heaven- if Heaven was carb- loaded cheese. They are delicious and a wonderful addition to any meal. Or, just make them the meal itself! Tapioca flour putting up a bread like facade, along with cheesy goodness- what more could you need?
