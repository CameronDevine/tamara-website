FACT: these waffles taste better when you use a Mickey Mouse Waffle Iron.

Another fact: You can freeze these waffles and then re-heat them in the toaster when you're in a hurry!

These waffles are FANTASTIC! We have had multiple people tell us that you cannot tell that they are gluten free. That is always the funniest and best compliment that I hear. It makes me feel a little more normal, and also like they must really like my food!

Seriously, a great breakfast/lunch/dinner recipe, for all ages, and all seasons! Add spices and condiments to your liking!

My go to:

1/2 batter: fresh, organic blueberries added to the batter

1/2 batter: Nestle Toll House Allergen Free Chocolate Chips

Once cooked, put Earth Balance soy free butter on them and enjoy! (p.s, I am not a fan of maple syrup but if you like it, I heard it taste great with these!!)
